** IPL Match Outcome Predictor (2008â€“2024)**

A Machine Learning project that predicts the winning team of an IPL match using historical match data and match conditions. Built with a Logistic Regression model and deployed using Streamlit.


ðŸ“Œ Objective
To build a machine learning model that predicts the likely winner of an IPL match based on input features such as city and total runs. The goal is to provide real-time insights useful for fans, analysts, and fantasy league players.

ðŸ§  Approach
Collected and preprocessed IPL match data (2008â€“2024) from Kaggle

Selected key features: match_id, city, winner, total_runs

Performed extensive data cleaning and feature engineering

Trained a Logistic Regression classifier

Achieved ~80% accuracy on the test data

Deployed the model with an interactive UI using Streamlit
